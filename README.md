## Usage

`/attention`: Code for the attention-based MIL model

`/baseline`: Code for the baseline CNN model (non-MIL)

In each:

`main.py`: Trains the model with the Adam optimizer for 20 epochs and evaluates it on the test set. Also sets up Comet ML logging for metrics.

`dataloader.py`: Loads the malware samples as images and generates the bags. Parameters: `lazy` - control pre-loading of samples into memory, `test` - indicate if loading a test dataset to make small images to log to Comet ML platform, `adversarial` & `adversarial_type` - control adversarial enlargement.

`model.py`: The model implementation.

`inference.py`: Similar to `main.py` but only for measruing inference speed. Includes GPU warm-up & GPU sync.

`inference_dataloader.py`: Similar to `dataloader.py` but only for inference. No pre-loading into memory.

`process_BIG2015_dataset.py`: Processes .bytes (hex) files from the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015) into .bin (binary) files, removing question marks.
